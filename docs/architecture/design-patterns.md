# Design Patterns Implementation

This document outlines the key design patterns used in our portfolio project, including their implementation details and rationale.

## Core Design Patterns Used

### 1. Repository Pattern
- **Where**: Data access layer for Projects, Profile, and Messages
- **Why**: Abstracts database operations, making it easier to switch databases or add caching
- **Implementation**:

### 2. Factory Pattern
- **Where**: Creating Project and Technology instances
- **Why**: Standardizes object creation, especially for different project types
- **Implementation**:

### 3. Observer Pattern
- **Where**: Analytics tracking and project updates
- **Why**: Enables real-time updates and loose coupling between components
- **Implementation**:

### 4. Singleton Pattern
- **Where**: Database connection, Authentication service
- **Why**: Ensures single instance for critical services
- **Implementation**:

### 5. Strategy Pattern
- **Where**: Image upload handling
- **Why**: Allows switching between different storage solutions
- **Implementation**:

### 7. Command Pattern
- **Where**: Project actions (create, update, delete)
- **Why**: Encapsulates requests as objects
- **Implementation**:

## Additional Patterns

### 6. Decorator Pattern
- **Where**: Authentication and logging middleware
- **Why**: Adds functionality to existing objects dynamically
- **Implementation**:

## Usage Guidelines

1. Always use the Repository Pattern for data access
2. Implement Factory Pattern for creating complex objects
3. Use Observer Pattern for loose coupling in event-driven scenarios
4. Implement Strategy Pattern when multiple algorithms might be used
5. Use Singleton Pattern sparingly and only for true global state

## Benefits

- Maintainable and scalable code structure
- Easier testing through dependency injection
- Flexible architecture that can adapt to changing requirements
- Clear separation of concerns
